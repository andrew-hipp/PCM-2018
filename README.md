Code, tutorials, and course materials for CEB35300, Phylogenetic Comparative Methods 2018

These tutorials are for a graduate course in Phylogenetic Comparative Methods. Tutorials have all been made using Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/) but can be viewed directly by clicking on the file name; they all appear to render correctly directly in GitHub

For any questions, please contact the instructor, Andrew L Hipp, ahipp@mortonarb.org, http://systematics.mortonarb.org/lab
